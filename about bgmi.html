    <br>
    <p> Each match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of the following Seven maps:</p>

        <br>
        <p>
         Each round, the plane's flight path across the map changes, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to eject and parachute to the ground.<br>
         Players begin with no equipment other than customised clothing options that have no effect on gameplay. Once on the ground, players can search buildings, <br>
         ghost towns, and other locations for weapons, vehicles, armour, and other items.At the start of a match, these items are procedurally distributed throughout<br>
          the map, with higher-risk zones typically having better equipment. Finished players can also be looted for their gear. Players can choose to play in first-person<br>
           or third-person,
         with each having advantages and disadvantages in combat and situational awareness.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Every few minutes, the map's playable area shrinks towards a random location, with any player caught outside the safe zone taking incremental damage and<br>
            eventually being eliminated if the safe zone is not entered in time; in game, the boundary appears as a shimmering blue wall that contracts over time.<br>
            This results in a more constrained map, which increases the likelihood of encounters. Random regions of the map are highlighted in red and bombed during the match,<br>
            posing a threat to players who remain in that area. Players are warned a few minutes before these events in both cases, giving them time to relocate to safety.<br>
            A plane will occasionally fly over different parts of the playable map at random, or wherever a player uses a flare gun, and drop a loot package containing items <br>
            that are normally unobtainable during normal gameplay. These packages emit highly visible red or yellow smoke, attracting interested players and resulting in additional confrontations. A full round takes about 30 minutes.
